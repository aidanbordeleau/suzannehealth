<h1><b>Welcome</b></h1>

<p> Welcome to Suzanne’s virtual therapy room - all are welcome. Please consider this site a warm invitation to explore resources chosen to help us move closer to your goals.</p> 

<p> Be this a new chapter in life for you, or a continuing novel with twists and turns; together we begin. </p> 

<p> As many times as we need to begin. 
Take your time to look around; let’s plan to share next time we are together.</p>
